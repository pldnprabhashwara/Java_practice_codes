# Java Practice Projects ☕️

This repository contains my first Java programs that I wrote while learning Java from scratch.  
These programs mainly focus on basic concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, arrays, and functions — but not yet Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Java syntax and structure  
- Input and output using `Scanner`  
- Using `if-else`, `for`, and `while` loops  
- Arrays and basic methods
